## Project Overview
This project is a simple backend for a login system, developed with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Its main function is to handle user authentication logic through a RESTful API, providing an entry point for the frontend application (client) to validate credentials.

**Key Technologies:** 

* Node.js & Express: For the server and route management.

* MongoDB: For the local database connection.

CORS & Body-Parser: For secure communication and handling of HTTP requests.

  ├─ package.json          # Dependencies and scripts
```

**Installation and Execution**
To get the local server up and running, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed.

Navigate to the main project folder.

Install the necessary dependencies with the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the local server by running:

```bash
node server.js
```
The server will be active and listening on http://localhost:5000, ready to receive login requests from your frontend.
